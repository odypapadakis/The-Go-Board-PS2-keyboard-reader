# The-Go-Board-PS2-keyboard-reader
 This is a project that connects a ps/2 keyboard to a " Go Board ".

 The "Go board" from nandland.com, is a small system that includes an FPGA, some peripherals and connectors on a circuit board,  allowing for easy creation of projects using an HDL such as Verilog or VHDL.

 This project will be initially created in Verilog. 
 
 
 The FPGA ( Lattice ice40HX1k ) on the go board operates at 3.3V Logic.
 The PS/s keyboard operates at 5.0 V .
  therefore a logic level converter circuit is included in the design.
