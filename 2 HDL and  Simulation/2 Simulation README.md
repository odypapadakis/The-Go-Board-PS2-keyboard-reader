## Part 2 - Simulation

Beore Trying to implement the project on the FPGA, A simulation using ModelSim will be performed.

For this Deisgn, Modelsim Lattice FPGA Edition will be used.

The Go Board Includes a PMOD connector.  2 pins from this connector will be used. They will be connected to the Data and Clock Signals coming from the PS/2 Keyboard.
